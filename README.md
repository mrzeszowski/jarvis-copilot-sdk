## 🚀 What is this?
A supercharged SDK for building copilots, sidekicks, and digital Jarvises (JARVI?) that help you code, automate, and maybe even make you coffee (feature coming in version 42.0).

## 🤖 Features
Talks to you more than your real friends
Writes code faster than you can say "rubber duck debugging"
Never complains about working late
0% chance of spilling coffee on your keyboard
🛠️ Installation
Just install it. Trust us, it’s easier than assembling IKEA furniture.

## 🧑‍💻  Usage
Add the SDK to your project.
Summon your copilot.
Watch as it tries to take over the world (or at least your codebase).

## 📝  Disclaimer
This SDK is not responsible for any AI existential crises, spontaneous robot dance parties, or sudden urges to refactor everything.

## 🦾 Contributing
PRs welcome! Bonus points for adding features that make the SDK laugh at your jokes.

## 📞  Support
If you find a bug, just yell "Hey Jarvis!" really loudly. If that doesn’t work, open an issue.
